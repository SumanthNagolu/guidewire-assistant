## Command Behavior

When any `/admin-XX-{epic}` command is executed:

1. Load epic documentation
2. Show epic overview and user stories
3. Check prerequisites are met
4. Ask: "Implement all stories sequentially? (y/n) or specify story IDs"
5. For each story:
   - Display story card (ID, title, acceptance criteria)
   - Generate implementation code
   - Create/modify necessary files
   - Add TypeScript types
   - Add tests
   - Verify compilation
   - Mark story complete
6. After all stories:
   - Run epic tests
   - Verify completion criteria
   - Update progress tracker
   - Suggest next epic

## Story Implementation Pattern

For any story ID (e.g., AUTH-001, BLOG-015):

```typescript
// 1. Show Story Card
Story ID: AUTH-001
Title: Admin Login Page UI
User Story: As an admin, I want a login page...

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Login page renders at /admin/login
- [ ] Email and password fields present
- ...

// 2. Confirm Implementation
"Implement AUTH-001? (y/n/skip)"

// 3. Generate Code
Creating: app/admin/login/page.tsx
Creating: components/admin/auth/AdminLoginForm.tsx
Modifying: middleware.ts

// 4. Verify
✅ TypeScript compiles
✅ Tests pass
✅ Linter clean

// 5. Mark Complete
✅ AUTH-001 completed (1/12 stories in Epic 1)
```

## Quality Gates

Before completing any epic:
- All stories must be ✅
- All tests must pass
- No TypeScript errors
- No ESLint errors
- No console errors in browser
- Mobile responsive verified
- Accessibility verified

## Integration Points

When implementing epic that depends on another:

```bash
# Example: Epic 6 (Blog) depends on Epic 11 (Media)

/admin-06-blog

> Checking prerequisites...
> ❌ Epic 11 (Media Library) not complete
> Required for: Featured image selector
> 
> Please complete Epic 11 first:
> /admin-11-media
```

## Error Recovery

If implementation fails:
1. Check error message
2. Review story acceptance criteria
3. Verify prerequisites
4. Check database schema
5. Review existing code
6. Try story again

If epic fails:
1. Review completed stories
2. Roll back if needed
3. Fix blocking issue
4. Resume from last completed story

## Progress Visualization

After each story:
```
Epic 1: Authentication
[████████░░░░] 8/12 stories (67%)

Overall Progress:
[██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 25/238 stories (10.5%)
```

## Notes

- Execute commands in Cursor chat
- Commands are case-sensitive
- Follow recommended execution order
- Test after each epic before moving to next
- Commit working code frequently
- Don't skip prerequisite epics
