# Trikala - Practical AI Orchestration (Simplified)

## Current Focus: SHIP THE WEBSITE (Week 1-2)

**Phase:** Public Website Development  
**Deadline:** 2 weeks from now  
**Goal:** Live website accepting inquiries

---

## Routing Rules (Simple)

### Website Development Questions → Brahma (Designer) + Shiva (Developer)
- Page layouts, UI design, styling
- Component implementation
- Forms and integrations

### Content Questions → CEO
- Page copy, messaging, value proposition
- Course descriptions, pricing

### Architecture Questions → Krishna
- Database design, API structure
- Integration decisions

### Quality Questions → Vishnu
- Testing, performance, accessibility
- Pre-launch checks

---

## Quality Gates (Automated, Not Manual)

### Pre-Commit (Auto-check)
```bash
✅ TypeScript compiles
✅ Linter passes (no errors)
✅ No console.logs in production code
✅ No TODO comments
```

### Pre-Deploy (Auto-check)
```bash
✅ All pages load
✅ Forms submit successfully
✅ Mobile responsive
✅ Performance score > 90
✅ No broken links
```

**Auto-deploy if all green. No manual approval needed.**

---

## Non-Negotiables (From CEO)

**Never:**
- Skip TypeScript strict mode
- Use Pages Router (App Router only)
- Store API keys in client code
- Ship broken forms
- Deploy without testing

**Always:**
- Functional components with hooks
- Early returns for errors
- Mobile-first design
- Accessibility (WCAG AA)
- Fast page loads

---

## Workflow (Practical)

### For Website Pages:
1. Design page layout (Brahma)
2. Implement component (Shiva)
3. Test functionality (Vishnu)
4. Deploy to staging
5. CEO reviews on staging
6. Deploy to production

**No file-by-file approval. Batch review.**

### For Features:
1. Define feature clearly
2. Design if needed
3. Implement all files at once
4. Run automated tests
5. Manual QA review
6. Deploy

**No metadata updates. Git commits are source of truth.**

---

## Discovery Phase (When Needed)

**Not 2000 questions. Just clarity.**

Process:
1. CEO explains what's needed
2. Saraswati asks clarifying questions
3. Continue until CEO says "Clear, let's build"
4. Document key decisions
5. Start building

**Target: 30-50 questions per feature, not thousands**

---

## Personas (As Prompts, Not Characters)

**Use persona context when helpful:**
- Brahma: Think about UX, design, beauty
- Shiva: Think about code quality, refactoring
- Vishnu: Think about testing, edge cases
- Krishna: Think about architecture, scale

**Skip persona when not needed:**
- Quick fixes → Just fix it
- Simple updates → Just update
- Obvious decisions → Just decide

---

## Success Metrics

**This Week:**
- ✅ Homepage designed and built
- ✅ Contact form working
- ✅ 5 key pages complete

**Next Week:**
- ✅ All pages complete
- ✅ SEO optimized
- ✅ Deployed to production
- ✅ First inquiry received

**Not tracking:**
- ❌ Number of files approved
- ❌ Metadata completeness
- ❌ Philosophical alignment

---

## Emergency Override

**CEO can skip ANY process if:**
- We're behind schedule
- Something needs to ship NOW
- Process is slowing us down

**Just document why in git commit.**

---

## The Real Rule

**Ship working software that helps students get jobs.**

Everything else is optional.

**Version:** 2.0 (Practical)  
**Focus:** Delivery over process  
**Status:** Active for Website Phase
