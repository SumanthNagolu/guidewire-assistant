- [x] **GUIDEWIRE-STYLE ACTIVITY SYSTEM**
- [x] Activity table linked to all core entities
- [x] Owner + Responsible/Accountable structure
- [x] Different activity types per department

**YOUR ANSWER:**

**"Task management, that's a big question. Like how do we want to handle the task is something that I thought about many times and CRM tools beta, zeta, monday.com, we have to either based on this, we create our own framework."**

**"I think in one of our early charts, I was mentioning about how I like really how Guidewire handles the concept of activities. For example, claim or a policy, the moment from the point of inception to the point of completion, the whole work track is split into activities."**

**"So, maybe again, the higher level, if you think about a quoting that would be a simple you know, activity, like first is to receive and then the second is to... But maybe, um... you know, polish it and third is to put it on our board, fourth is the sourcing, for sourcing also if you want to break it down, we can break it down. But at least you know what I mean. The entire flow, the same, if you're talking about bench sales, then we're talking the same thing."**

**"Like Bench sales was talking about a candidate. Maybe today you know daily activities or end of the day to be able to handle a candidate it essentially falls as some activities but when it comes to bench sales that's this activity should be recurring or extended where the same activity is continuing for a very long time."**

**"If there is someone to source the candidate, so probably everyday activity will have to split for themselves. Since this is day specific activity or recruitment is role-specific activity whereas if we come to talent acquisition then we are talking about targets so let's say it's every lead-specific activity what are all the activities that we would need to be able to identify and onboard the lead."**

**"And you can think about like any other one like management and all like somehow have an activity table which is linked to all these core tables or entities and and use it and you know every activity will have an owner, use it and... Probably we can go with the two owner concept where one is responsible and the other one is accountable or whatever."**

**"When I say CRM mine like the basic tables and all I understand but I what what I need your input from this. You know, they have support and all based, you know, employee monitoring tools like taking, you know, attacking the keystroke count or mouse clicks or the applications or the websites that the employee is using or collecting the screenshots for auditing purpose, all of that. HubSpot does, I know, but I'm not sure how HubSpot does. How feasible it is to get our own version of it."**

**"But if we... if integrating is the best option then yes. One thing I would say is, a lot of our billings are in India, which will cost us a lot of money. In architectural design, whenever we are choosing the applications, first preference obviously will go to the Indian billings. We have tools like Zoho, if not, say, HubSpot, but I'll let you pick."**

1. **Build own CRM** (with employee monitoring tools)
2. **Integrate with Zoho CRM** (India-based, cost-effective)
3. **Integrate with HubSpot** (feature-rich, but expensive)

**"I'm not looking for employees, I'm looking for partners. This is a partnership deal."**

- **5% of GROSS revenue** to the pod on every deal

### **2. GUIDEWIRE-STYLE ACTIVITY SYSTEM** 🎯

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DECISION:**
- **Activity table** linked to ALL core entities
- **Two-owner model:** Responsible (does work) + Accountable (oversees)
- **Sequential workflows:** Job → Activities → Completion
- **Recurring activities:** Bench sales, ongoing work
- **Different patterns per department:**
  - Recruiting: Sequential, role-specific
  - Bench Sales: Recurring, extended
  - Talent Acquisition: Lead-specific, target-based
  - Training: Day-specific, recurring

- **Hierarchy:** View (all) → Edit (managers) → Delete (admins)

### **6. INTEGRATIONS:**
- **Microsoft 365** (email, calendar, Teams)
- **Job boards:** LinkedIn, Indeed, Naukri, all major boards
- **SMS/WhatsApp:** Twilio + WhatsApp Business API
- **AI:** OpenAI + Anthropic + Google (multi-model orchestration)

### **7. EMPLOYEE MONITORING:**
