- [x] ALL OF THE ABOVE + MORE
- [x] Complete holistic view from bottom to top

**YOUR ANSWER:**

**"Companies like KPIs, department performance comparison, real time, pretty much everything that I see here and whatever would make sense. You know, essentially every information that I would need as a CEO to know the company at a glance and steer the direction."**

**CEO Dashboard - Complete View:**

**1. Company-Wide KPIs:**
- Revenue (real-time, trends)
- Placements completed
- Active jobs
- Candidates in pipeline
- Students enrolled/graduated
- Bench utilization

**2. Department Performance Comparison:**
- Recruiting health
- Training/Academy health

- Each department's key metrics side-by-side

**3. Real-Time Activity Feed:**
- What's happening right now across all departments

**4. Alerts/Critical Issues:**
- Anything requiring CEO attention
- Performance drops
- Goals not met
- System issues

**5. Team Performance Overview:**
- Pod health metrics (how each pod is running)
- Individual pod status at a glance

**6. Financial Snapshot:**
- Revenue, expenses, profitability
- Per department, per pod

**7. Growth Trends:**
- MoM, QoQ, YoY comparisons
- 5-year, 10-15 year trajectory

**8. Pod Health Metrics:**
**"When I see the CEO dashboard, I need to see how each pod is running and if you consider each pod and give it a health metrics or whatever the metrics that you want to track, it should clearly resemble where it stands."**

**9. Workflow Health (Production Line View):**
**"Holistic perspective starting at bottom to top. That's what the dashboard should also represent in one or the other way."**

- Process flow visualization
- Bottlenecks identification
- Time tracking per stage
- Steps taking longer than expected

**Purpose:**
"Make sure that if it's going, coming along in the direction and you know, stay on track."

**Key Principle:** Dashboard represents both STATUS and WORKFLOW HEALTH - not just numbers, but the production line efficiency.

**Q17:** How granular can CEO drill down?

- [x] FULL DRILL-DOWN - All levels
- [x] CEO = Extension of the system

**YOUR ANSWER:**

**"Upside down. It's me. Nothing but me. So I'm the extension. It's the extension of me. So there's nothing that I couldn't... I cannot see."**

**Drill-Down Levels:**
✅ **Department level** (Recruiting → all recruiting metrics)
✅ **Pod level** (Pod 1 → Pod 1 details, performance, workflow)
✅ **Individual team member level** (John → John's work, activities, performance)
✅ **Transaction level** (Placement → full placement details, history, all related data)

**Philosophy:**
"It's the extension of me" - CEO has unrestricted visibility into every level of the organization.

**Implementation:**
**"Maybe not at the glance, but I should be able to have an option to go deeper levels."**

- At-a-glance: High-level overview
- Click any metric → Drill down to next level
- Click again → Deeper level
- Continue drilling until transaction/individual level

**Iteration Approach:**
**"Maybe again, if you think it's too complex in the iteration one, we can keep enhancing it down the line, but that's the idea."**

- Iteration 1: Basic drill-down (department → pod)
- Future iterations: Full drill-down to individual/transaction level
- Goal: Complete transparency for CEO

---

**Q18:** Does CEO dashboard show all departments, or customizable?

- [x] All departments always visible (comprehensive view)

**YOUR ANSWER:**

CEO needs to see all departments at once for holistic oversight. Single view with ability to drill down into each department.

---

**Q19:** What time ranges for data display?

- [x] Multiple strategic timeframes (ALL)
- [x] Sprint to 15-year planning horizon

**YOUR ANSWER:**

**"What time ranges for data? Probably we can have some kind of a filter."**

**Strategic Planning Timeframes:**

**"At least we'll need to, you know, whenever I state the direction I want to give it:"**

1. **Sprint** - 2 weeks
2. **Monthly** - 1 month
3. **Quarterly** - 3 months (quarter)
4. **Yearly** - 1 year
5. **5-Year Plan**
6. **10-15 Year Plan**

**Implementation:**
- Filter/dropdown to select timeframe
- Default: Current sprint or month
- Quick toggles: Sprint | Month | Quarter | Year | 5Y | 15Y
- All views show comparison to previous period
- Data aggregation appropriate to timeframe

**Purpose:**
Enable strategic planning at all levels - from tactical (2-week sprints) to visionary (15-year trajectory).

**"They should be able to see the sprint which is 2 weeks and a month and a quarter and then a year then 5 years and then 10 years or 15 years."**

**Key Insight:** Track both the NUMBERS and the PROCESS HEALTH.

**Workflow Visualization:**
```
Job Posted → Sourcer (1hr target) → Screening → Account Manager → Client Submission → Interview → Placement
```

Each stage shows:

**Q23:** Should department dashboards show cross-department data?

- [x] Yes, show relevant cross-department insights

**YOUR ANSWER:**

**"At this point of time, probably not, but maybe as the example you just gave would make sense. But so whenever we have maybe a show relevant cross department inside."**

**Strategy:**
- Show **relevant** cross-department insights only
- Example: Bench Sales sees "20 students graduating from training next month"
- Example: Recruiting sees "15 candidates available on bench"
- Example: Training sees "Client demand for Java developers high (5 open positions)"

**Implementation:**
- Not full access to other department's data
- Only relevant aggregated insights
- Helps with planning and coordination
- Maintains data isolation while enabling strategic visibility

---

## **2.3 Visualization & Display**

**Q24:** What types of charts/visualizations do we use?

- [x] ALL OF THE ABOVE

- **Historical:** Trends, comparisons, long-term analytics
- **Hybrid:** Some metrics show real-time with historical context

**Implementation:**
**"Maybe when you're working on the actual dashboard we can look at the different types of information or sections that we are working on. Handle it accordingly."**

- Determine per metric/section
- Real-time where it matters (current operations)
- Historical for trends and planning
- Smart refresh intervals (not everything needs live updates)

---

- [x] Customizable
- [x] Start with best defaults (iteration 1)

**YOUR ANSWER:**

**"I want it to be customizable for sure."**

**"But iteration one again if you... since this is closer AI we can... you can just go with the best and create customizable."**

**Strategy:**

- Healthy workflow status
- On time performance

**Yellow (Warning/Below Target):**
- Below target but within acceptable range
- Approaching threshold
- Needs attention

**Red (Critical/Action Needed):**
- Significantly below target
- Performance penalties triggered
- Immediate action required

**Integration with Performance Matrix:**

**For Department Heads:**
- "Your department: 100 placements"
- "Other departments: [Bench: 50, Training: 20]"
- "Company total: 170 placements"

**"But in any way, that's the idea. Few people or multiple people are doing the similar thing or competing. And we can see what percentage we have. So have a baseline as the average of the team and the ratio."**

---

**Q33:** Do we show rankings/leaderboards?

- [x] YES - For motivation

**YOUR ANSWER:**

**"Rankings, leaderboards, maybe yes for sure. Again that's all the team running metrics for team motivating factors."**

**Activities as Workflow:**
**"And we are using activity as a means to make sure that every step is done and also set a process where for any complex flow, it's broken down into multiple series and sequential steps of activities."**

**"And we keep assigning activities one after another, depending on who it needs to go."**

**"And in the end, whenever all these activities in a box is done, that means the entire box and the task is completed."**

**Implementation:**
- Every action = Activity
- Activities track workflow progress

- Must have appropriate permissions
- Logged in audit trail
- Role-based restrictions apply

---

**Q38:** Dashboard loading performance - how fast should it be?

- [x] 3-5 seconds acceptable

**YOUR ANSWER:**

**"Loading performance, acceptable again. If it's an... I think I would say three to five is okay. One, two, three and three to five depending on that would be a switch for between a compromise and a win."**

**Performance Targets:**
- **3-5 seconds:** Acceptable (comprehensive data, worth the wait)
- **Goal:** Balance between performance and data completeness
- **Implementation:** Progressive loading where possible (show key metrics first, then details)

---

**Q39:** Historical dashboard views - can users see "what dashboard looked like last month"?

- [x] YES - For period-to-period comparison

**YOUR ANSWER:**
