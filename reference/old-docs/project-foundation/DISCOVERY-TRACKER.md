- I document answers
- I ask follow-up questions if needed
- Move to next batch

**2. Clarification**
- If answer is unclear, I ask follow-up
- If I need examples, I request them
- If edge cases exist, we explore them
- Nothing assumed

**3. Documentation**
- Every answer documented immediately
- Organized in category files
- Cross-referenced where needed
- Always accessible

**4. Validation**
