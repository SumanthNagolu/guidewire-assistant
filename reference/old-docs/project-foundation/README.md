## 🌱 THE ORGANISM PHILOSOPHY

**This system is designed to:**
- ✅ Think like you (founder's principles embedded)
- ✅ Learn from every interaction
- ✅ Grow organically (new pods, new features)
- ✅ Self-optimize (performance tracking, automation)
- ✅ Advise intelligently (CEO dashboard, insights)
- ✅ Scale naturally (internal → B2B → IPO)

**Not just software. An extension of your business mind.**

**Next:** Capture raw vision, then structure it properly.
