- Focus > Comfort

### **1. Extension Philosophy**
"This application is like an extension of myself... like how we have many hand tools as extension of hand and us.. a living organism."

**Meaning:**
- Software should extend human capability
- Not replace humans, amplify them
- Organic growth, not forced scaling
- Self-learning, self-optimizing
