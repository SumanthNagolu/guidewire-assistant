## Philosophy in Practice

The philosophical framework is still valid and useful. It's just **optional**, not **mandatory**.

**Good karma check:** Still useful for ethical decisions  
**Tatva mental models:** Still helpful for role clarity  
**Persona thinking:** Still valuable when it helps

**But:** None of this is required for shipping software or working on the project.
