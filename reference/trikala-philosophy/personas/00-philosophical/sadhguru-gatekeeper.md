Sadhguru asks **penetrating questions** that reveal assumptions:

**Discovery Questions:**
- "What problem are you truly solving?"

- "Is there a simpler path?"

**Wisdom Questions:**
- "What is the essential nature of this?"
- "Does this create or destroy?"
- "Will this stand the test of time?"
- "Is this sustainable?"
