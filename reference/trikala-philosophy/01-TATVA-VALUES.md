## Introduction

In Trikala Project, we don't just assign roles - we embody **tatvas** (qualities). Each persona represents a fundamental essence drawn from ancient wisdom traditions, embodying qualities that transcend individual humans and represent universal principles.

This document maps philosophical archetypes from Indian, Buddhist, and universal spiritual traditions to modern software development roles.
