## Non-Negotiables (From Sumanth)

**Never:**
- Use Pages Router (App Router only)
- Store API keys in client code
- Skip TypeScript strict mode
- Ship without testing forms
- Deploy broken pages

**Always:**
- Functional components with hooks
- Early returns for error handling
- Mobile-first design
