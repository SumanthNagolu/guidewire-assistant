# Cursor Reset Context — 2025-11-11

## Project Snapshot
- Goal: launch the public Guidewire Training Platform marketing site within two weeks (Week 1–2).
- Deadline: end of Week 2 with homepage live, 3+ core pages, and functioning contact form.
- Tech stack: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript (strict), Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Supabase, Stripe, Resend/SendGrid, Vercel hosting.
- Non-negotiables: App Router only, no client-side API keys, strict TypeScript, tested forms, accessible/mobile-first design, WCAG AA compliance.

## Current Branch & Repo State
- Branch: `main`.
- Pending work: marketing pages, dashboards, API routes, scripts, config files, and new directories. See `git status -sb` (captured 2025-11-11) for the full list of modified/untracked items prior to Cursor reinstall.
- Recommendation: ensure any critical local changes are committed/pushed before reinstalling Cursor.

## Active Goals & Focus
- Week 1 deliverables: homepage hero + CTA, About, Programs, Pricing, Contact (with form), FAQ, Blog structure.
- Week 2 follow-up: SEO, email integration, analytics, mobile testing, performance optimization, deployment.
- Quality gates: no ESLint/TypeScript errors, no production `console.log`, no `TODO` markers, forms validated.

## Cursor Reset Checklist
- Backup Cursor-specific preferences (keybindings, theme, extensions) if customized.
- Export `.env*` values or API credentials stored outside the repo.
- Documented conversation transcript: `docs/conversations/chatgpt/2025-11-11-cursor-reset.md`.
- Post-reinstall: sign in, reopen `/Users/sumanthrajkumarnagolu/Projects/intime-esolutions`, reload project docs, verify dev server (`npm run dev`) and linting.

## Context for Future Agents
- This session focused on preparing for a Cursor reinstall to reset API settings while preserving project impact.
- All prior ChatGPT/Cursor conversation archives remain under `docs/conversations/` and `docs/cursor-agent-history/`.
- Use this note plus the referenced transcript to restore context quickly after the reset.
