# InTime Recruiting Pod Structure & Workflow — Complete Blueprint

## I. Vision & Pod Philosophy
Recruiting at InTime operates on the principle of **ownership, precision, and visibility**. Each client account is treated as a micro-business unit — with clear accountability from business development to final delivery. The goal is to ensure every requirement is addressed systematically, every candidate is traceable, and every client interaction is documented for repeatable success.

**Objective:** To build a **three-to-four-member recruiting pod** capable of handling end-to-end delivery — from requirement intake to successful onboarding — while maintaining high responsiveness, quality, and measurable performance metrics.

## II. Recommended Pod Composition
| Role | Experience Level | Core Focus | Description |
|------|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Sr. Recruiting Manager (Pod Lead)** | 6–8 years | BDM, Account Management, Delivery | Owns client relationship, manages delivery, leads pipeline strategy, and ensures SLAs are met. Primary point of contact for clients and internal leadership. |
| **Recruiter / Sourcing Specialist (x2)** | 2–4 years | Sourcing, Database Building, Screening Support | Handles requirement-specific sourcing, leverages internal/external databases, conducts initial screening, and manages the candidate pipeline. |
| **Recruiting Coordinator / Junior Recruiter (x1)** | 0–2 years | Documentation, Formatting, Reporting | Manages resume formatting, compliance checks, submission tracking, and report generation. Supports sourcing team with candidate follow-ups and documentation. |

This structure allows rotation — recruiters can interchange roles between sourcing and screening as volume or complexity changes. The Sr. Manager remains the single point of escalation and delivery assurance.

## III. End-to-End Recruiting Workflow

### Step 1: Client Intelligence & Account Blueprint
- **Purpose:** Build a knowledge base for each client to ensure faster, informed execution.  
- **Owner:** Sr. Recruiting Manager.
- **Deliverable:** A **Client Cheat Sheet** maintained in the *Recruiting_Accounts Board* including:
  - Client overview (domain, scale, team size, market presence).
  - Submission preferences (resume style, format, approval authority, TAT expectations).
  - Common roles and technical stack.
  - Hiring pattern and response behavior (historical data from prior submissions).
  - Communication channels (POCs, escalation matrix).
  - Reports on performance (fill ratio, average turnaround, feedback trends).

This becomes the “rulebook” for cracking the client account.

---

### Step 2: Business Development & Requirement Intake
- **Owner:** Sr. Recruiting Manager.
- **Activities:**
  - Proactively identify new clients, partners, and BDM leads.
  - Manage existing accounts — maintain weekly check-ins and gather forecasts.
  - Receive new JDs from account POCs, clarify open questions, verify rates and work arrangements.
  - Clean and format the JD into the **InTime JD Template**.
  - Create an entry on the **Recruiting_Requirements Board** with tags (client, tech stack, priority, SLA, assigned team).
  - Assign to sourcing specialists with SLA-based targets.

---

### Step 3: Sourcing & Database Management
- **Owner:** Sourcing Specialists.
- **Activities:**
  - Start from **trusted internal database candidates** (InTime Alumni, Bench, Prior Placements).
  - Expand to **referrals** and **network pools**.
  - Move to **external job boards** — Dice, Monster, CareerBuilder, LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, etc.
  - Maintain sourcing order: Internal → Referral → External.
  - For each role, shortlist 10–15 potential candidates.
  - Add all prospects into the **Candidate_Master Board** with sourcing status and contact details.
  - Provide initial comments for availability, visa, location, and rate.
  - Maintain accuracy and freshness of pipeline data.

---

### Step 4: Screening & Evaluation
- **Owner:** Screening Team / Cross-functional Recruiters.
- **Activities:**
  - Conduct detailed interviews (15–30 mins) covering:
    - Technical, functional, and communication skills.
    - Availability, relocation, rate expectations.
    - Work authorization and project timelines.
  - Prepare an internal **Candidate Screening Sheet** for every candidate.
  - Ensure resume formatting in the InTime standard format (branding, font, consistency).
  - Verify references, previous projects, and delivery readiness.
  - Mark final shortlisted profiles and move to the **Screened_Candidates Board** for final verification.

---

### Step 5: Final Review & Submission
- **Owner:** Sr. Recruiting Manager.
- **Activities:**
  - Review shortlisted resumes and screening notes.
  - Re-screen or verify technical skills if required.
  - Ensure complete documentation: formatted resume, submission form, RTR (Right-to-Represent), references, and summary.
  - Make final submission to client/MSP and log details in **Recruiting_Pipeline Board**.
  - Initiate feedback loop tracking via **Submission Tracker**.

---

### Step 6: Tracking, Coordination & Delivery
- **Owner:** Sr. Recruiting Manager + Coordinator.
- **Activities:**
  - Maintain daily follow-up cadence with clients.
  - Record feedback, interviews, and rejections.
  - Handle resubmissions, replacements, and onboarding logistics.
  - Coordinate with finance for placement confirmation and invoice triggers.
  - Maintain **Recruiting_Delivery Tracker** for each account with live status (Submitted → Interview → Offer → Started → Invoiced).

---

### Step 7: Reporting & Continuous Improvement
- **Owner:** Pod Lead + All Members.
- **Activities:**
  - **Daily:** Review submissions, client responses, bottlenecks.
  - **Weekly:** Review metrics (submissions vs. interviews vs. placements).
  - **Monthly:** Update the client cheat sheet, analyze patterns, and improve sourcing strategy.
  - **Quarterly:** Account audit — check compliance, hit ratio, and business potential.
