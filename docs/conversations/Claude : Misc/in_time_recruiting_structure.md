## II. Organizational Structure (Day 1 → Scalable Model)

### 1. Leadership Layer

**Senior Recruiting Manager (SRM)**

- Functions as both **Business Development Manager (BDM)** for new clients and **Account/Delivery Manager (AM/DM)** for existing ones.
- Owns **assigned accounts end-to-end** and is fully accountable for delivery, client satisfaction, and business retention.
- Oversees the **entire recruiting cycle** — from client reporting, requirement intake, sourcing assignments, and screening oversight to final delivery closure.
- Implements a continuous workflow, assigning sourcers (30–60 mins to start pipeline) and screeners (30–60 mins to finalize profiles) for steady production.
- Handles client escalations, anticipates delivery challenges, and resolves issues proactively.
- Reviews all internal submissions, validates documentation, formats per client standards, and performs final submissions.
- Tracks submissions through interviews, offers, and onboarding, ensuring a seamless handoff to HR.
- Leads daily stand-ups, manages metrics, and ensures transparent reporting across all pod activities.

### 2. Senior Execution Layer

**Recruiting Manager / Lead Recruiter**

- Acts as the **operational core** for assigned JDs — managing sourcing, screening, and submission end-to-end.
- Upon receiving a JD, supplements attached profiles with additional candidates from internal databases and personal networks.
- Conducts first- and second-level screenings, compiles final submission files, and ensures data integrity across Monday.com boards.
- Coordinates closely with sourcers and the SRM to maintain a **continuous, flowing pipeline** with zero idle time.
- Serves as a **lead generator** — turning each candidate conversation into potential leads for recruitment, bench, or training pipelines.
- Owns JD throughput, ensuring minimum candidate submissions, complete records, and data accuracy.
- Enforces quality, compliance, and audit-readiness for every JD in the system.

### 3. Execution Layer

**Recruiters / Sourcing Specialists**

- Manage the **execution and movement** of JDs assigned from leads or SRMs.
- Source candidates following the internal process playbook: Internal Database → Referrals → External Portals.
- Conduct initial screenings and attach candidates directly to JDs in Monday.com, maintaining records that are **complete, clean, and accurate**.
- Ensure continuous JD activity with no lapses or stagnant cards.
- Coordinate daily with SRM and Lead Recruiters to maintain a steady workflow and timely submissions.
- Identify potential candidates who can be repurposed as recruiting leads, future bench consultants, or training prospects.
- Meet the daily minimum submission goals and maintain full data compliance.
- Uphold accuracy and completeness from sourcing to submission.
- Manage resume formatting, documentation (RTR, BGVs, references), and compliance tracking.
- Update Monday.com boards, maintain candidate records, and assist SRMs with submissions, reporting, and onboarding documentation.

## III. Process Flow — The Continuous Production Model

> **Objective:** Maintain an overlapping production line where sourcing, screening, and submission flow in parallel for maximum efficiency.

### Step 1: JD Intake & Planning (8:00–9:00 AM)

- SRM identifies or receives new JDs, validates details (skills, visa, rate, location, timeline), and posts them to the **Recruiting\_Requirements Board**.
- Assigns JD to sourcers with SLAs for immediate action — sourcing begins within 30–60 minutes.

### Step 2: Morning Cycle — JD One (9:00–11:00 AM)

- Sourcer identifies 10+ candidates using internal, referral, and external sources.
- Screener begins evaluations mid-cycle to maintain momentum.
- SRM reviews progress and prepares the second JD for assignment.

### Step 3: Midday Flow — JD Two (11:00 AM–2:00 PM)

- Second JD is introduced as the first moves toward submission.
- Screeners conduct 15–20 minute calls and forward top 3–5 candidates for SRM review.
- SRM validates, formats, and submits approved profiles.

### Step 4: Afternoon Cycle — JD Three (2:00–4:00 PM)

- New JD added to maintain rhythm and ensure constant throughput.
- Recruiters balance ongoing follow-ups, fresh sourcing, and feedback updates.
- SRM manages submissions, escalations, and client coordination.

### Step 5: Closure & Delivery (4:00–6:00 PM)

- Final submissions, interview scheduling, and follow-ups.
- All boards (Requirements, Candidate Master, Pipeline, Delivery Tracker) updated.
- SRM compiles and shares a daily summary highlighting JD closures, interviews, and offers.

**Outcome:** Each pod processes **3–4 JDs daily**, maintaining uninterrupted workflow — one JD entering as another closes.
