## 🚀 ONCE YOU'RE DONE DUMPING

Tell me: **"I've dumped all conversations, analyze them"**

I'll:
1. Read everything (takes 10-30 minutes depending on volume)
2. Give you a synthesis report
3. Ask clarifying questions
4. Create comprehensive vision documents

**The more you dump, the better I understand your vision.**

No conversation is too small or too rough. Dump it all. 🎯
