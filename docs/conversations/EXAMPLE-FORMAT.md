## 🎯 KEY POINT

**I can read ANY format. Don't waste time formatting perfectly.**

Just dump content. I'll extract the ideas.

Examples of what I can handle:
- ✅ Copy-pasted chat logs
- ✅ Exported markdown files  
- ✅ Plain text files
- ✅ Rough notes
- ✅ Bullet points
- ✅ Stream of consciousness
- ✅ Screenshots (as images)
- ✅ Mixed formats

**More content = Better synthesis**

Don't hold back. Dump everything. 🚀
